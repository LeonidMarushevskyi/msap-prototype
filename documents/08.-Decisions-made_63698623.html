                    <div id="main-content" class="wiki-content group">
                    <h2 id="id-08.Decisionsmade-Data">Data</h2><p>In order to provide a better user experience, we decided to extend child care provider data with full addresses.Use of full addresses provides the ability to map provider data for better visualization of information and comparison of providers based on an identified important criteria - distance. The data set provided by State of Mississippi was based on Texas data and real City/County names. At the same time, the real addresses of Child Care Centers (but not homes) are also available to the public. So we used Google API to generate some addresses.</p><p>Based on the caseworker interview data and additional data gathered from possible users (parents / case workers), we identified other factors users would like to use to evaluate child care providers.  The caseworker interviews provided agreement that the data could be extended and we have proposed the following additional data elements:</p><ul class="inline-task-list" data-inline-tasks-content-id="63698623">
<li data-inline-task-id="1">Openings available - randomly generated data. Most facilities have available slots.</li>
<li data-inline-task-id="2">Working hours - depends of Facility type we create some reasonable hours. Some facilities also receive Second Shift, Overnight And Weekend/Holiday hours.</li>
<li data-inline-task-id="3">Price - we use Child Care Aware data for year 2015 and generate normally distributed values rounded to $5 for all age groups supported by facility</li>
<li data-inline-task-id="4">Special needs support - some Child Care facilities randomly receive Special Need support ability</li>
<li data-inline-task-id="5">Number of complaints, visits, substantiated allegations - randomly generated data.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="id-08.Decisionsmade-UserGroups">User Groups</h2><p>There are four different user groups identified for the prototype - parents, foster parents, caseworkers, providers. Provider case is not supported in prototype due to limited time.</p><p>To currently address the short term need for input, the following process was used for identification of feedback groups.</p><ul class="inline-task-list" data-inline-tasks-content-id="63698623">
<li data-inline-task-id="6"><span> Broad parent communication channels (discussion groups) with open membership</span></li>
<li data-inline-task-id="7"><span>Used the same parent groups for foster parent feedback as the needs were similar and scenarios could be described easily</span></li>
<li data-inline-task-id="8"><span>Caseworkers known to our identified interviewer and not to the team</span></li>
<li data-inline-task-id="9"><p>Future effort would involve either third party service (such as Loop to identify potential audience) or working with the State to create the target user groups for feedback.. </p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="id-08.Decisionsmade-Features">Features</h2><p>Before prototyping, we received clear vision that we should add some communication feature (chat or messaging) to the application, based on user surveys.</p><p>Due to limited time we did not implement three side communication Foster Parent - Caseworker - Provider. We also did not implement Parent's review feature for Child Care Facilities. According to the development  process both features are placed to the Project backlog.</p><p>Some users showed interest in the side by side facility comparison - this feature goes to backlog.</p><h2 id="id-08.Decisionsmade-Tools">Tools</h2><p>We will use SurveyMonkey rather than EngagePoint Assist for gathering input from independent parties.</p><p>We also use Loop11 as advanced usability check tool</p><h2 id="id-08.Decisionsmade-Other">Other</h2><p>From caseworker meeting we received information that some non-English language support will be needed. Spanish and Vietnamese are the options for user interface now.</p><p> </p>
