                    <p><strong>00.00  - 04:02</strong></p><p>Initial problem description</p><p><strong>04:02 - 07:18 Cases when Caseworker needs to find the Child Care facility</strong></p><p>Questions:</p><p>Please describe the process of Child Care provider selection using Caseworker role.</p><p>Why you will look for some Child Care, not Foster Care as Caseworker. Provide some scenarios.</p><p>Shelly:</p><p>First I wanna know  Is it licensed?</p><p>As Foster Care Caseworker looking for Child Care for a perspective family and a perspective child</p><p>Same for Adoption worker</p><p>School Social worker with after school care need</p><p>Special need child care</p><p>I need to know what is available and know what is the number of children in that Child Care facility.</p><p>Pediatrician Social worker looks for specific Child Care to fit medical needs</p><p>I wanna look at with very specific nature, I wanna know how many kids, I wanna know what kind of need those currently have<br />In case of home I wanna know what this family is licensed for how many placements. Age ranges description. It depends from the State.</p><p><strong>07:18 - 08:22 Special Needs</strong></p><p>Special needs - them usually do not tell what kind of special need them deal with</p><p><strong>08:22 -09:57 Respite Care</strong></p><p>Question: Would Caseworker be using this for specific Respite care needs or on regular basis? In order when you need to do a therapy and need to place child for soem period of time.</p><p>Not sure that State will be able to use it on that manner. It will be great if them have the Child Care facilities ready for short term.</p><p>What happened in our State is that - for spring brake, Christmas you can drop your child for one day, three days. A lot of Home care do not support that. More Centers do that.</p><p><strong> 09:57 - 11:53 Licensing</strong></p><p>Question: In Mississippi it appears Licensing for Centers and Certification for smaller facilities. When you say licensing do you put the difference between these two categories or simple that they have a valid certificate of operation.</p><p>Shelly:</p><p>They have to have a valid certificate. However the State define it. If you are a Home Day Care you have to be licensed. Center or Group home facilities - everything must be licensed. And again other states can do it different way. If foster ids have their Day Care coverage them must be in licensed Day Care facility.</p><p>Grammy or Aunt down the street can not be a Day Care provider for a Foster Child and have a State pay for it.</p><p><strong>11:53 - 14:39  Weekly rates</strong></p><p>Questions: Do you know about any kind of decisions made using weekly rates information.</p><p>Shelly: Yes them pay attention on amounts. That is based on what State will pay versus Private will pay.</p><p>As Foster Care worker I am looking for a facility and:</p><p>State will pay $2.52 an hour for daycare - $100 per week. And daycare charges $300 per week. So Foster parent must pick up another $200.</p><p>You are Parents on Public assistance and you gave Day care assistance - those families can afford the difference.</p><p>Knowing the price and knowing the price gap is very important.</p><p>How them do the billing? - upfront or not. Monthly, weekly. All these billing components are important.</p><p><strong>14:39 -  16:10 More payment details</strong></p><p>How to identify who will pay for what?</p><p>As Foster Care caseworker looking for Child Care</p><p>A portion of payment come from State. Some foster parents will pay the diff. Some will ask State to find the facility with full coverage by state and them will travel if needed.</p><p><strong>16:10 - 20:14 Worker options</strong></p><p>Caseworker who is dealing with In Home services or CPS worker working with family. Identify the need of Child Care support.</p><p>It can be even home based therapist. Child protective services.</p><p>Family centered view - how Day Care possibilities supports this family. Even respite care. Or mother or father works.</p><p>How an adaption caseworker will functioning? Same way?</p><p>Adoption parents must pay the cost of Day Care no matter why. But in case of special need Adoption caseworker will try to find right place for a child.</p><p>In case for example of Autism traditional Day Care is not an option.</p><p>Financial support for Adoption with Special Need depends on a State. (California possible, Wisconsin - no, Maryland - no)</p><p><strong>20:14 - 23:49  Security related to address</strong></p><p>Do you know any kind of non public information in Child Care facility profile? caseworker Only?</p><p>Answers:</p><p>Confidentiality issues around houses. Yard to find it.</p><p>In this case provider shall share some details like &quot;on bus line&quot; or something like this.</p><p>In some states all of the addresses are on web site</p><p><strong>23:49 -27:25 Communication with provider</strong></p><p>Subscription for Home information via Email</p><p>Ask via Email, text or chat. Special needs + opening availability.</p><p>Case when no call but text. I am open for call from 8 to 9 am.</p><p><strong>27:25 - 29:50 Schedule an appointment</strong></p><p>Availability info for Caseworkers and Parents. Should have an option to visit any time.</p><p><strong>29:50 -33:25 Safety</strong></p><p>Provider expertise</p><p>Children with trauma  - need to know who will take care of them</p><p>How many helpers are in the room</p><p>History of the facility. CPS calls. How long children stay in this Child Care facility?</p><p>I wanna know Children in and out pattern. <br />What the facility is doing to keep everybody safe?</p><p>History of abuse for the house.</p><p><strong>33:25 - 39:00 Recommendations from parents</strong></p><p>I wanna see recommendations from parents.</p><p>We talking about safety of children. And making sure that we have enough information.</p><p>Different information for Caseworker vs Parent - I want the same information!</p><p>Form exists to outline the visit with questions to ask Day Care provider.</p><p>If you are not an educated parent you can ask questions.</p><p>Avoid &quot;forgot to ask&quot; key question situation.</p><p><strong>39:00 - 41:15 Compare facilities</strong></p><p>Side by side comparison.</p><p>Criteria used to compare:</p><p>Services provided, Cost, How many children they have.Ages of children. What kind of activity the do. Areas of interests.</p><p>As Caseworker I want to know how many CPS visits/allegations. What are the challenges for this facility? And again I want to know cost.</p><p>Do you have openings?</p><p><strong>41:15 - 44:05 Open hours</strong></p><p>That is a critical issue. Late policy - 5 minutes - $5</p><p><strong>44:05 - 47:20  Pool and Transportation</strong></p><p>Pool always must be safe. Lifeguard required in some states. Life saving certificate.</p><p>Transportation is huge. Some facilities will provide transportation from school to facility. In some cities day care facilities bring children home.Chicago - send a bus to pick the kids up. Bigger city feature. In the small town you usually do not have transportation.</p><p><strong>47:20 -53:40 Key factors - fast communication and short commute</strong></p><p>Number of children. In case of Special Need you try to find smaller than larger.</p><p>For CPS Worker it is a time sensitive process. No time to wait for response from Day Care Facilities. Can I go look this facility with mom. Two way communication goes quickly.</p><p>To compare two homes/centers I want to know what are my options in transportation with reasonable time. Avoid long commutes.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p>
