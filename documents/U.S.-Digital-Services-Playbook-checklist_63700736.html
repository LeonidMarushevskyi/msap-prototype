So it took 7 days.<br /><br /></li><li>We used interactive Axure wireframes for regular usability testing with users in the early stage of development. Based on feedback obtained through usability testing, we quickly incorporated changes to the wireframe over the course of a two-day development cycle for the Design Group. <br /><br />When MVP became available after Sprint 1, we switched usability testing to the actual application prototype.<br /><br /></li><li>EngagePoint realized the importance of effective communication within the Scrum team. We used daily standups to share progress reports and to resolve any blockers and stoppers. We used <a href="https://www.skype.com" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">Skype </a>for instant communication between team members as well as group chats for different activities like Development, Deployment, and QA.

This minimizes efforts otherwise required for manual review. Automated code review was managed using SonarCube, which controlled the quality of the source code, caught simple coding bugs, validated code duplication, code coverage, etc.<br /><br />In addition to automated code review, we practiced cross-team review.

The JVM platform is commonly used in high-load web applications, such as Google. However, small prototype web applications can also be created quickly and then transitioned to production usage on the same technology platform without having to entirely rewrite the application.<br /><br />Prototype development using the JVM platform is the correct choice due to the availability of qualified developers, low development and support cost, and low risk in the short- and long- term.  <br />EngagePoint used the open source code generator <a class="external-link" href="https://jhipster.github.io/" rel="nofollow">JHipster</a>, which let us generate a generic application based on <a class="external-link" href="http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/" rel="nofollow">Spring Boot</a>, <a class="external-link" href="https://angularjs.org/" rel="nofollow">AnglarJS</a> with incorporated minimal for production usage functionality such as user management, user roles, configuration, and monitoring.<br /><br />Hipster provides tools that accelerate development and reduce the need for custom coding. Entity Generator supports application prototyping, allowing the Technical Architect to describe the standard Entity Relational Diagram using JDL (a domain specific language). Based on JDL, JHipster generates the boilerplate code needed for simple CRUD operations with these entities: <a class="external-link" href="http://www.liquibase.org/" rel="nofollow">Liquibase</a> scripts for database objects, Hibernate entities, repository classes, Java REST resources, AngularJS controllers, REST client services, routers, unit tests for Java and JavaScript, and sample administrative UI.<br /><br />The prototype has two maven profiles: DEV and PROD. The DEV profile is used on the local development environment and incorporates in-memory H2 and Elasticsearch engines. Spring Boot provides an embedded lightweight application container, Tomcat, which runs the prototype. We used <a class="external-link" href="https://www.browsersync.io/" rel="nofollow">Browsersync</a> and <a class="external-link" href="http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/using-boot-devtools.html" rel="nofollow">Spring Boot Devtools</a> for automated reload of front-end and back-end code. These techniques reduce development time to seconds as the developer views updates in real time. The PROD profile builds the prototype’s production version, which is optimized for production use.<br /><br />EngagePoint chose AngularJS for front-end development because this JavaScript MVC framework is mature and widely used. AngularJS is open source and is one of the most popular projects on GitHub. There are an enormous amount of publicly available components for AngularJs. <br /><br />For back-end development, EngagePoint <span style="color: rgb(255,0,0);">selected the</span> Spring Boot project, which <span style="color: rgb(255,0,0);">helped</span> to implement the application based on Spring Framework faster. Spring Framework in conjunction with Spring Boot provides a solid development platform for implementation of applications with unlimited complexity and performance requirements.<br /><br /></p></li><li>EngagePoint <span style="color: rgb(255,0,0);">chose</span> to use PostgreSQL relational database as<span style="color: rgb(255,0,0);"> the</span> main persistence storage. This database is the most advanced open source relational database that <a class="external-link" href="https://www.postgresql.org/about/featurematrix/" rel="nofollow">provides features</a> comparable with proprietary databases like Oracle and DB2.
