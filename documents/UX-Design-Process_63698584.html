                    <p>Our design process consists of the following four phases that include a repeatable cycle:</p><ul><li><p>Research</p></li><li><p>Analysis</p></li><li><p>Design</p></li><li><p>Testing</p></li></ul><h5 id="UXDesignProcess-Research">Research</h5><p>The Research phase entails the collection of stakeholder information and specific, clear, concise business needs for an application. The Research</p><p>process also includes the gathering of User and Subject Matter Expert (SME) needs and expectations.</p><h5 id="UXDesignProcess-Analysis">Analysis</h5><p>The Analysis phase entails the identification of User roles and Use cases, creating mock data and personas to represent application expectations</p><p>and behaviors for typical User groups and identifying proper data elements for User needs.</p><h5 id="UXDesignProcess-Design">Design</h5><p>The Design phase entails creating a wireframe Axure prototype that reflects the navigation of the collected application data elements that were</p><p>proposed for the system development. This includes specific examples of composed data that can be demonstrated to a User for review and</p><p>response. Once the details of the prototype design are solidified, the design pages are finalized following specific design standards (such as</p><p>colors and page layouts).</p><h5 id="UXDesignProcess-Testing">Testing</h5><p>The Testing phase entails having actual users assess and analyze the designed Axure prototype for user acceptance. The testers will have some</p><p>detailed system scenarios/scripts that define clear goals and questions to be answered.</p><p>This phase also includes the collection of particular generic case or user situations that have not been acknowledged but need to be, so that the</p><p>prototype does not omit any required relevant functionality for the end user needs.</p><p>This phase stage imitates the Research phase described above, as it illustrates the process from a user interaction point of view, initiating the</p><p>repeatable cycle procedure.</p><p>When we understand that some part of our application is firmly developed in Axure, meaning, there are no significant changes from last approved</p><p>design session, then the design will be modified to include the backlog with additional User stories and associated functionality/changes,</p><p>combined into epics by use case addressed. These changes will follow a defined, approved configuration management process.</p>
